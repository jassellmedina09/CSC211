Question 1:
------------------
To get the program to print 10, you can add an if statement.
if i = 10, cout i. 

Question 2:
------------------
You could format an infinite loop by using a while loop. (or for)

Question 3:
------------------
Problem with the incrementation (i). Instead of --i, ++i to make the loop continue.

Question 4:
------------------
Maybe the first if statement should be a else if. 

Question 5:
------------------
the output line could go below the if statement, but I think it looks good.

Question 6:
----------------
The output should go in curly brackets in the if (i == 10) because its just getting repeatted twice when its already been written.

Question 7:
------------------
