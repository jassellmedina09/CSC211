Question 1:
-----------
We can store a string at position 9 because 10 is reserved for the null terminator, which is /0.

Question 2:
-----------
the largest size string we could store is size 10.

Question 3:
-----------
If a tring has no null terminator, it will not work correctctly and can cause bugs.

Question 4:
-----------
the copy() function copies a sequence of characters from a string. 
it takes in three parameters, which are:
s, which is pointer to array
len, the number of characters to copy
pos, the position of the first character to copy. aka where to start.



Question 5:
-----------
the swap() function swaps string values. You would simply take the name of your string and stick a .swap() at the end.
Inside the swap parameters goes string name you want to replace. 
for example: 
std::string face ("sunnies"); // declare strings names and values
std::string waist ("belts");

std:: cout << "in summer, kids love to wear" << face;
std:: cout << "but hate " << waist << '\n';

// swapping here
face.swap(waist)

and making an output statement the same as the old one would output
that kids love wearing belts in the summer but hate sunnies. 

Question 6:
-----------
The insert() function inserts additional characyers into  astring 
right before the characyer indicated by pos. 
It has multiple versions because of the C++ updates in the past.

It can take the parameters of:
pos, str, subpos, sublen, s, n, c, p, (first, last), and il.
