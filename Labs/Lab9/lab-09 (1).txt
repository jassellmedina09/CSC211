Question 1:
-----------
When the stack grows, old ones start to drown out as the new ones are pushed in. 

Question 2:
-----------
When the stack shrinks, the program keeps running. 

Question 3:
-----------
foo(6) calls- foo(3) calls- foo(2) calls- foo(1) calls- foo(1)

Question 3:
-----------
After three recursive calls, the stack is:
fact(3) top
fact(4)
fact(5) bottom


Question 4:
-----------
sum_digits(123) - sum_digits(1234) - sum_digits(12345)
top -> bottom

Question 5:
-----------
tacocat ends up at the bottom of the stack. Top of stack is acoca. 


Question 6:
-----------
After 3 recursive calls the stack is:
([3,4,5,6,2],5) top of stack 
([2,3,4,5,6,2],6)
([3,4,5,6,2],5)
([1,2,3,4,5,6,2],7) bottom of stack
